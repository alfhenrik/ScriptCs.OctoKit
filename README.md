==============================
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/j024yq10dbfovsxi/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hnrkndrssn/scriptcs-octokit/branch/master)
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ScriptCs.Octokit.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScriptCs.Octokit)

## About
This is a [Script Pack](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki) for [scriptcs](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs) that can be used to interact with the GitHub API using [octokit.net](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net).

## Installation

Install the NuGet package by running `scriptcs -install ScriptCs.Octokit`

## Usage

There's three different ways to create your GitHubClient:
- Anonymous - access to public information only
- Basic Auth - using your GitHub username/password
- OAuth Token - using a personal access token (Account Settings->Applications->Personal Access Token)

#### Anonymous
```csharp
var octokit = Require<OctokitPack>();
var client = octokit.Create("MyAwesomeScriptCsGitHubClient");
var userTask = client.User.Get("alfhenrik");
var user = userTask.Result;
Console.WriteLine(user.Name);
```

#### Basic Auth
```csharp
var octokit = Require<OctokitPack>();
var gitHubClient = octokit.CreateWithBasicAuth("MyAwesomeScriptCsGitHubClient", "myusername", "mypassword");
var userTask = client.User.Current();
var user = userTask.Result;
Console.WriteLine(user.Name);
```

#### OAuth Token
```csharp
var octokit = Require<OctokitPack>();
var gitHubClient = octokit.CreateWithOAuth("MyAwesomeScriptCsGitHubClient", "myusername", "myoauthtoken");
var userTask = client.User.Current();
var user = userTask.Result;
Console.WriteLine(user.Name);
```

#### Build, create, test and publish NuGet packages

_This is purely here as a reminder for me to remember how to build, create and publish new versions of ScriptCs.Octokit to NuGet._

##### Build
```
git clone https://github.com/alfhenrik/ScriptCs.Octokit.git
cd ScriptCs.Octokit
.\build.cmd
```

##### Create NuGet package
 - Open the ReleaseNotes.md file in the root of the repository
 - Add a new entry to the file in the format `* x.y.z - Release notes`

Then run the following command in a shell from the root of the repository.
```
.\build.cmd CreatePackage
```

Once the NuGet package has been created run the following commands to test the new package.
```
.\build.cmd RunEndToEndTests
```

##### Publish NuGet package to NuGet.org
To publish the NuGet package to NuGet.org, run the following command.
```
.\build.cmd PublishPackage "NuGetApiKey"
```

##### Create release on GitHub
